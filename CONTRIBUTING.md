## 📦 Branching Strategy

We follow a **type-based branch naming convention**.

Please create branches using one of the following formats:

- `feat/<feature-name>` – For new features  
- `fix/<bug-description>` – For bug fixes  
- `docs/<document-change>` – For changes to README or docs

🔸 Examples:
feat/unsubscribe-button
fix/email-parsing-error
docs/update-readme


> ⚠️ Note: Your branch name must match one of the protected patterns (`feat/*`, `fix/*`, or `docs/*`) to be eligible for merging.
